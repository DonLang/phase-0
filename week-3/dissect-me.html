<h2> Git and Github</h2>
<p>
      Git is a popular VCS that is used by quite a few developers, and is very useful for open source projects.  Git is software we download on our computers that allows us to make “save points” for our project.  It also allows copies to be made so that others can modify the project too.  Then they can all be merged into a whole.  To make this easier it is a good idea to use a someone else to host the project.  And that is where GitHub comes in.

      That in a very broad way is what I learned in camp this week.  Plus the code to make it work, and quite a bit about being a responsible programmer.  Thanks for your time.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I used <article>, <section>, and <h2> in this challenge, but I find myself particularly fond of <aside>, <nav>, <header> and <footer>.  Frequently returning to them
How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements are laid out based upon the tags and CSS intructions like blocks you move around. I'm still a bit unclear as to what order is used to display elements but https://friendlybit.com/css/rendering-a-web-page-step-by-step/ seems to indicate that a DOM tree is made, stylesheets are parsed, and then the tree is rendered with the style info for each node/tag.  Ish... I'm still working on understanding it.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned about the snippet tool, and how it can be useful in several ways to add code that you'll be using often. I also learned about the built in reindent function that should be very useful in making my code clean and easy to read.
