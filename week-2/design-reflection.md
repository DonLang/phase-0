###What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
#####Information gathering -
Developing an understanding of the objective of the site, who is the intended audience,  what impact you wish to have upon the audience, and what content you plan on displaying.
#####Planning -
Creating a site map to show what information you’d like on the site, and how you’d like  your user to navigate it.
####Design -
Getting a good idea of the colors, fonts, and overall appearance you want your customers to view.  It seems quite important to take into account your target audience during this time.
 ####Development -
The actually building of the site.  This is where you take the work that you did before in design and make it real using your HTML/CSS skills, and whatever other tools you need to make your users experience wonderful.
####Testing/Delivery-
The fine tuning process where the you makes certain that all the code works, and that the product is useable by all of your intended audience.  Then you deliver the finished product using a FTP program, and make sure the site still runs after it has been set up.  This stage also includes Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to make certain your target audience can find this new thing you’ve built for them, by making it easier to locate in search engines.
####Maintenance -
Adding new content, and products to keep the site fresh, and engaging for your audience.  This allows you to help your target audience have access to the things you want to share with them.
Also includes routine backups, updates, and other such things to make sure your site is able to reach the users you want it to.
###What is your site's primary goal or purpose?What kind of content will your site feature?
I think my sites primary goals would be to show case my talents to potential employers, and an useful teaching tool to fellow programmers.
###What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Employers would probably be most interested in my abilities which should be showcased in my project section, and in my personality which I will attempt to demonstrate in the about me section.
Fellow programmers I feel will be more interested in my blog posts, any new projects, and a little in the about me section.
###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
Employers should be able to navigate to my portfolio easily, and if they like it be able to contact me with their needs.
Fellow programmers should be able to access blog entries easily, and search for the information they need to help them learn.
###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
At each step of the process remember the person who will be using the product, and what you would like their experience to be.  Since your goal is to share with the user products, services, or advice that you feel they would want; you should tailor your site to be a pleasant way to give them access.
###What is user experience design and why is it valuable? Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
User experience (UX) design is intentionally planning out your site to optimize the human- computer interface (HCI).  This means that you design your site around making the experience for the user match their needs by being user friendly, and efficient.  It is valuable because it enables your user to concentrate on the content of the site not the mechanics of how to get to it, and makes it easier for you to help your user get the information/products/services you want to share with them.
I don’t think I found any of this challenge tedious; although I still find it a bit challenging to articulate what I’ve learned in an efficient fashion.
