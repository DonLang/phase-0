## 1.1 Think About Time
I touched on the Pomodoro Technique (more furthered my knowledge of it), checked out BJ Fogg’s Tiny Habits idea, checked out what meditation tip were on the site and bounced off into a wonderland of Time Boxing techniques.

To the best of my understanding Time Boxing is breaking down an activity into finite amounts of time (called a Time Boxes) that can be used to measure progress; after finishing a box the activity is evaluated to see what has been accomplished.   I plan on using Time Boxing to limit my tendency to go down the rabbit hole when learning during Phase 0, and keep me a bit more focused on achieving results.

My normal time management technique tends toward having an overarching to do list for the day, with flexible times for delivering results, and a freeform joy in learning. A bit  chaotic but it seems to work (although it did lead to going over the one hour guideline for studying time management by about 45 minutes). Given the more structured environment of Phase 0 I've migrated to using the Pomodoro Technique.

My normal strategy works fairly well for most situations, but I do like the idea of scheduling nonproductive moments more effectively.  I also  find that sometimes I will go off on a researching tangent and I like using Pomodoro to keep me on one subject per time box. I plan on exploring the method more during Phase 0, and using the breaks to develop a few habits from Fogg’s method.
## 1.2 The Command Line
To the best of my current understanding a shell is a program designed to interpret commands for the computer.  Bash is a shell and a command language that is fairly common.

The most challenging part of this was just remembering to be precise and not make mild syntax or typing errors.

I was able to successfully use all of the commands.

I’m certain my opinion of which commands and arguments are the most useful will change over time but I like the man command quite a bit,ls -a, pwd, and cd.  With those I can navigate wherever I’d like and learn how to use new commands to manipulate whatever I find there.

pwd - Print working directory (shows you where you are)

ls - list contents of directory

mv - move or rename

cd - Change directory

../ - go or act up one directory

touch - makes a file

mkdir - makes a directory

less - shows content of a .txt file

rmdir - removes an empty directory

rm - remove files and full directories (using -r)

help - a command used to understand commands built into the shell (like the man command which i’m a bit more fond of)
