#####What is a wireframe? -
A wireframe is a mock up of the structure of your website.  You use a series of boxes to stand in for the content that you’ll be adding, and use it to build a skeleton for your site.  It allows you to analyze the user experience without needing to fill in everything, and gives you an idea of what your site is going to be like.
Wireframes should include the location of features, buttons, text, and such. This will help you code the spaces for them later.  It shouldn’t have the color scheme, font choices, or finished design elements.  This is a skeleton after all it doesn’t have to be pretty it just has to show you how things fit.
#####What are the benefits of wireframing? -
Wireframing has quite a few benefits.  It allows you to manipulate your site visually before it is coded, making it easy to make changes, and see what features you need to improve user interface.  It makes coding easier by showing you where to build buttons boxes, and other bits of your site.  It also encourages you to see beyond the logo and pretty colors. Designing a site that is easy on the user, and more fun to navigate.
Wireframing is also kinda fun.  It engages your imagination, and helps you see the beginning of the site you want to build.  You can rapidly cycle through quick sketches until you’ve found the right one for you and your clients.
#####Did you enjoy wireframing your site? -
Very much so! :) It was fun trying out new ideas, wandering through the internet using Wirify to see the amazing things people have built and try and guess why.  Although I don’t know if I will have enough content for my image of a site, I’m excited to see it built.
#####Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea? -
Revised, revised, and revised again.  I have a simple wireframe to come back to if I’m unable to figure out how to make the image above work, but I like the idea of making something as user friendly as what I see in my head.
#####What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
The earliest question was “What is a wireframe?”, but the course material pretty much covered that.  Then “How many types of wireframes could there possibly be?”, which seems to be way more than I can count.  Wirify (a bookmarklet that converts any site into a wireframe) http://www.wirify.com/ helped with that.  Then “Which sites do I enjoy using and how are they set up?” , and “Woah does how the site is structured really impact how much I enjoy it that much?”.  Both of which were answered by probably way too much time online.
The finally two questions were “Am I ever going to look at a site the same way?”, and “Is it in my best interest to spend another pomodoro on this challenge surfing the net?”.  The answer to both I fear is no.
#####Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed looking wireframes of websites, and learning more about design.  I found the part where I made a change in the master part of my git accidentally, and had to learn to do a hard reset somewhat tedious.  But I don’t blame that on wireframes it isn’t their fault. :)
