- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was fun.  I liked being able to see my work manifest on screen. I quite enjoyed working with someone else who could reign me in when I wanted to rabbit hole and go overboard.  MVP all the way!
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
We definitely had some interesting comments regarding some of the elements that are apparently no longer needed in html5.  We both found ourselves wanting to use the <head> element even though JSFiddle recommended against it (where else would we contain our meta tags and title) mostly to keep things organized and neat.  While I get that html5 defaults to using the “UTF-8” character set we also added that tag.
It was nice to bundle the left and right content into <section>s to separate them so we can move them around later.  And we were perhaps overzealous with the <span>s whenever we were curious as to if the text might need to be formatted differently.  I am also fond of <header> and <footer> mostly to use as this side up this side down when formatting.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
My use of <hr> to set in horizontal rules might be a violation, but according to this http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hr.asp  it now is used for thematic change.  So I may have cheated a little, but not right?
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good…
It is quick and allows you to build the skeletons of things that you can make beautiful.
It is old tested and true.  Gives it a good sense of longevity.
The bad…
I find it a little hard to intuitively read.  Ruby is easier to stare at the code and figure out where you went horribly wrong.
All the <> </> open and closing can be hard to keep track of.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Make my open and close tabs at the same time.  Test code frequently.  Don’t rush, be patient.  Sorry that is all I got.
