# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#The first method iterates through the source using .each and uses the include? method to find the thing_to_find.  Then I push it to the found array which is my output.
#The second method iterates through the hash using the .select to locate those values that are equal to the thing_to_find, it would normally return the keys and values.  Then I used .keys to return an array of only those keys.
# I'm still not great at using the docs so my method was scanning the docs to think of things that might work, trying them, and seeing how they fail.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
