###Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
If you have a GitHub account open it, otherwise go to github.com and make one following their instructions.  After you’ve opened you account go to the + sign in the upper right hand corner (next to your avatar), and click it.  Then click on new repository.  Go down to the Repository name field and name your repository.  Make it public or private and add any licenses you might need.  Then click the Create repository button.  And now you have a repository on GitHub.
One more step is necessary to get started on you repository, cloning it to you computer.  First click on the repository in your GitHub, and go to the lower right hand side to the field that says https copy that information.  Next go to your terminal program (you can find it in macs by using finder and typing terminal), and enter in the following command:  git clone the_https_info
Replacing the_https_info with the https stuff you copied from GitHub.  And then you’ll have a copy of the repository on your computer.

###Describe what open source means.
Open source is a method by which people allow others to access their software (or other projects) for collaborative purposes, or just to supply people with cool tools to play with.

###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
It feels like a good way to trust others while still establishing consequences for misuse of that trust.  Rather like baby steps toward making a world where people can rely upon mutual benefit to ensure responsible behavior instead of fear.  So I guess I’d say it feels like the beginning of utopia.

###Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow us to control the use of our software to some degree, have some protection from others claiming credit for our work, and allow the software the freedom to be a tool for anyone who need it.  Depending on the licensing restrictions we placed upon it we can limit the alteration, distribution for profit, and many other elements of its life.  I’d say they were pretty important, but still would like to work towards a world where the fear of legal repercussions wasn’t the motivation for responsible behavior.

###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
My interest in intellectual property law was even more solidified during this challenge, and I did greatly enjoy reading about different licensing options.  I’m still struggling a bit with being both clear and concise in these assignments.  I feel like I’m blathering on a bit.

###Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Not really.  Conversations with wonderful artists, developers, and lawyers have deepened my understanding of property law, but they might be too many to easily list.  Doing the html and css module on codecademy made the html easy to comprehend, but I don’t feel it was necessary.
