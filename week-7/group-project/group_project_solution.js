/As a user i’d like to do three things to a list of numbers.
Using “sum” and the list I want to add together all the numbers whether the list is even or odd in length.
I’d like to use “mean” to return the average of all the numbers in the list.
Finally I’d like to use “median” to return the median number of the list./
